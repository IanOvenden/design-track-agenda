## Requirements

You have a blank canvas on design but the following needs have been identified
- Attendees need to view the agenda ‘at a glance’ on their smart phones during the conference
- Presenters want to display the entire weeks agenda via laptop & projector
- Attendees and presenters want the ability view a single days’ events (‘day in view’)
The design needs to visually distinguish the different categories of events on the design track schedule
- Travel & Registration
- Breaks & Meals
- PegaWORLD main conference events
- Mobile
- User Centered Design
- Customer Centricity
- …All others grouped together

## Constraints

On Wednesday attendees will be split into 2 parallel tracks – the agenda needs to show the split tracks where appropriate
Must support
- iPhone 6 & 7 (iOS 10 & 11)
- Samsung Galaxy (Android 6 Marshmallow & 7 Nougart)
- Web browsers: IE11; Google Chrome; Safari; Firefox
- Comply with minimum WCAG ‘A’ Standard Accessibility.
